    <h1>Welcome to my website. Now lets talk about cats and dogs.</h1>
    <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.</p>
    <p>Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior, and they can thrive on a starch-rich
         diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
